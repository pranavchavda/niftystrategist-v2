I've retrieved the full documentation for the requested paths. 

The first document, `/docs/api/liquid/objects/linklist`, describes the `linklist` Liquid object, which represents a menu in a Shopify store. It details the properties of a `linklist` object, including `handle`, `levels`, `links`, and `title`. It also provides an example of a `linklist` object in JSON format.

The second document, `/docs/apps/build/online-store`, discusses methods for integrating apps into online stores. It covers theme app extensions, other integration methods for themes (like `ScriptTag` and `Asset REST Admin API`), and app proxies. It also provides guidance on choosing the appropriate integration method and considerations for building online store apps, including how to handle remote products.

The third document, `/docs/api/liquid/basics/types`, explains the basic concepts of Liquid, focusing on data types, object handles, logical and comparison operators, and whitespace control. It provides examples for each concept, including how to create and modify handles, reference handles, use the `contains` operator, and understand truthy and falsy values in Liquid.
